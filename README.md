Translations from CSS and Sass to other Languages

When I was learning Clojurescript found it really helpful to have [Clojurescript Synonyms](https://kanaka.github.io/clojurescript/web/synonym.html) available as I knew a little bit of Javascript at the time, so I was able to relate and connect the dots learning from what I already knew. This project aims at the same goal for anyone who wants to know how to relate from CSS/Sass/JS to other languages and projects.
